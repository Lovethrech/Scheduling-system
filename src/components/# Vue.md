 # Vue.js Login Form with Form Validation

This project demonstrates how to create a login form with form validation using Vue.js. The form includes fields for username, password, and an authentication code. The form is styled using CSS and includes a custom error message for each field.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

* Node.js and npm installed
* Vue.js installed

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm run serve` to start the development server.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the login form.

## Code Overview

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the Vue.js application.
* `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that defines the Vue.js application.
* `FormInput.vue`: A Vue.js component that represents a form input field.
* `FormSubmit.vue`: A Vue.js component that represents a form submit button.
* `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the login form.

### FormInput Component

The `FormInput` component is a reusable Vue.js component that represents a form input field. It takes the following props:

* `labelName`: The label text for the input field.
* `pattern`: A regular expression pattern to validate the input value.
* `labelPositionPlacement`: The position of the label text relative to the input field.
* `name`: The name of the input field.
* `errorMsg`: The error message to display if the input value is invalid.
* `type`: The type of the input field (e.g., `text`, `password`, etc.).
* `min`: The minimum length of the input value.
* `max`: The maximum length of the input value.

The `FormInput` component uses the `v-model` directive to bind the input value to a data property in the parent component. It also uses the `@input` event to validate the input value and display an error message if the value is invalid.

### FormSubmit Component

The `FormSubmit` component
